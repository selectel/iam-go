# Create & Delete User

This example program demonstrates how to manage creating and deleting User.

The part of deleting a just-created User is commented.

As an example, the Billing Role will be assigned for a new User.

## Running this example

Running this file will execute the following operations:

1. **Create:** Create is used to create a new User.
2. **(Delete):** _(commented by default)_ Delete deletes a just-created User on a previous step.

You should see an output like the following (with both operations enabled):

```
Step 1: Created User ID: 12345... Keystone ID: 1a2b3c...
Step 2: Deleted the User ID: 12345...
```
